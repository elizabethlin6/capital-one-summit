To solve this challenge, build a web app that provides:

Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
Which start/stop stations are most popular?
What is the average distance traveled?
How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?




(Optional) Bonus features you may want to include to stand out:

How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc
Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and
where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?
What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?
