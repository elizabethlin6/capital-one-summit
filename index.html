    <center><h2>My Plan</h2></center>
    <p>In my project, I utilized raw datasets to determine data trend within the LA Bike Share dataset. I used the languages R and Python to calculate values and visualize my data. Specifically I used plotting function in RStudio and the dplyr library to work with the .csv files which were later converted to R data frames.<br>
    <br>
    I utilized a DOM model where I had my code (.R and .py files) in a separate folder contained in the HTML/CSS structure. I referenced what each code file printed out as the solution to my problem. Furthermore, in my visualizations, I used the dplyr library to filter and mutate my data frames and to calculate new values. I also used RÂ plotting functions (like bar plot and pie chart) to craft efficient data visualizations into image files for viewing.<br>
    <br>
    In the presentation of my data, I used Python to calculate and write the latitude and longitude values onto Tableau Desktop. The Tableau Desktop plotted each coordinate in a Map so we can see where each station is located (start, end).<br>
    <br>
    Prior to working on this web application, I didn't know how to use R and manipulate data frames. I had only previously used Python for data structures. However, I was able to pick up the R language and use RStudio to easily manipulate my data and calculate values that would be difficult to do in Python.<br>
    My main takeaway from this project is to always understand your data before you work with it. I crafted an efficient approach towards answering the proposed questions and even made my own questions to answer.<br>
